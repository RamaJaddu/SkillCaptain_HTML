Introduction to HTML

What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages. It provides a way to describe the structure of content on a web page using various tags and elements.

Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document is structured using several essential elements:

- <!DOCTYPE> Declaration: This declaration specifies the HTML version being used. For HTML5, the declaration is <!DOCTYPE html>.
- <html> Element: The root element that wraps all content on the web page.
- <head> Element: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title (<title>), character encoding (<meta charset="utf-8">), and links to external resources like stylesheets (<link>).
- <body> Element: Contains the main content of the web page, including text, images, links, forms, and other elements visible to users.

Adding Headings, Paragraphs, and Line Breaks

- Headings (<h1> to <h6>): HTML provides six levels of headings, <h1> being the most important (often used for main headings) and <h6> being the least important (used for subheadings or minor sections).

Example:
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>


- Paragraphs (<p>): Used to structure blocks of text. Each <p> tag defines a new paragraph.

Example:
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<p>Another paragraph follows.</p>
- Line Breaks (<br>): Inserts a line break within text, useful for breaking lines without creating a new paragraph.

Example:
This is a line.<br>
This is another line.
Example HTML Document Structure

Putting it all together, a basic HTML document might look like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    
    <p>This is a paragraph introducing the page.</p>
    
    <h2>Section One</h2>
    <p>This is another paragraph in section one.</p>
    
    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph in section two.</p>
    
    <p>Two lines of text.<br>
    Line two.</p>
</body>
</html>
Explanation

- <!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
- <html>: Root element wrapping the entire document.
- <head>: Contains meta-information and links to external resources.
- <body>: Contains visible content like headings, paragraphs, and line breaks.

This structure forms the foundation of every HTML document, providing the basic framework to create web pages that are structured, readable, and accessible to users and web browsers alike.
